GitLab pipeline library for [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io), enabling seamless integration of GitLab services into your workflows.

## Documentation

- **[Pipelines →](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gitlab/pipelines)**

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

### Credentials

By default, the following environment variables will be used for authentication:

- `GITLAB_TOKEN`

You can also create `credential` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/gitlab.fpc
```

```hcl
credential "gitlab" "default" {
  token = "glpat-..."
}
```

For more information on credentials in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Credentials](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/credentials).

### Usage

[Initialize a mod](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/index#initializing-a-mod):

```sh
mkdir my_mod
cd my_mod
flowpipe mod init
```

[Install the GitLab mod](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies) as a dependency:

```sh
flowpipe mod install github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-gitlab
```

[Use the dependency](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/write-pipelines/index) in a pipeline step:

```sh
vi my_pipeline.fp
```

```hcl
pipeline "my_pipeline" {

  step "pipeline" "get_project" {
    pipeline = gitlab.pipeline.get_project
    args = {
      project_id = "99999999"
    }
  }
}
```

[Run the pipeline](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/pipelines):

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run my_pipeline
```

### Developing

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-gitlab.git
cd flowpipe-mod-gitlab
```

List pipelines:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline list
```

Run a pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run get_project --arg 'project_id=99999999'
```

To use a specific `credential`, specify the `cred` pipeline argument:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run get_project --arg 'project_id=99999999' --arg cred=gitlab_profile
```
